# Myntra-Clone
A Myntra clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based replica of the popular online fashion and lifestyle store. This project aims to recreate the user interface and basic functionality of the Myntra website, providing a visually appealing and interactive shopping experience. The HTML structure includes various sections for product listings, categories, and user accounts. CSS styles the application to closely resemble the original Myntra design, while JavaScript handles dynamic content loading, user interactions, and other essential functionalities.
